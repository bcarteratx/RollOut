### _Motivation_:

These are strange and frightning times for everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic. Forced to stay at home, people are panic buying all available toilet paper. With supplies running low, every roll must be accounted for. If only there were an app to assist those in need. Luckily for them there is, welcome to Roll-Hoarder!
